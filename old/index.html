            <p>Hi, my name is Theo, and I am originally from Montgomery County, Maryland. Currently, I am getting my M.S. of Computer Science at UC Irvine.</p>
            <p>Previously I worked at the MITRE Corporation for two years prototyping systems for the Air Force.</p>
            <p>Some of my interests include software engineering, machine learning, distributed systems and architectures.</p>
            <p>As a person, I try to challenge myself every day. I like challenging myself in my work and outside of work looking for new experiences.</p>
            <p>I speak German and Dutch fluently as well as English! When I am not working I like to go on adventures outdoors. Some of my current hobbies are surfing and trail running.</p>
