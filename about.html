    <div>
        <p>Hi my name is Theo Jagodits and I am from Montgomery County, Maryland. Currently, I am studying at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ.</p>
        <p>Some of my interests include data science, web development, parallel computation, machine learning, algorithms and high performance computing.</p>
        <p>As a person I try to challenge myself every day. I like challenging myself in my work and outside of work looking for new experiences.</p>
        <p>I have many different hobbies like cooking, doing trialons, and brewing beer. I also speak three different languages. Feel free to ask me about my hobbies!</p>
        <p>I would love to talk to you about anything and everything.</p>
